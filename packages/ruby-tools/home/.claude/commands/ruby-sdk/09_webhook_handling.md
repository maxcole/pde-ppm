I need to implement webhook support in my Ruby SDK for [API_NAME].

Webhook details:
- Event types: [LIST_EVENT_TYPES]
- Payload format: [DESCRIBE_PAYLOAD_FORMAT]
- Authentication method: [WEBHOOK_AUTH_METHOD]

Please provide code that:
- Implements a webhook handler that can be mounted in a Rails app
- Verifies webhook authenticity
- Processes events properly
- Provides an event callback system
- Includes error handling
