I need to implement the core API client for my Ruby SDK that interfaces with [API_NAME].
Here are the API specifications:

Base URL: [BASE_URL]
Authentication method: [AUTH_METHOD - e.g., OAuth2, API Key, Basic Auth]
Rate limits: [RATE_LIMIT_DETAILS]

Key endpoints to implement:
[LIST_ENDPOINTS_WITH_HTTP_METHODS_AND_BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]

Please provide the Ruby code for a well-structured API client that:
- Handles authentication properly
- Implements proper request/response processing
- Has good error handling
- Follows Ruby best practices
- Is easily extensible
- Handles serialization/deserialization
- Includes retry logic for transient failures
