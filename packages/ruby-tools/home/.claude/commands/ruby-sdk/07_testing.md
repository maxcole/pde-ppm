I need to develop a comprehensive testing strategy for my Ruby SDK for [API_NAME].

Please provide guidance and example code for:
- Unit testing approach with RSpec
- Integration testing approach
- Mock/stub implementation for API responses
- VCR setup for recording real API interactions
- Test coverage requirements
- CI integration recommendations

The SDK handles sensitive data, so please include best practices for testing without exposing secrets.
