I need to implement a Ruby model class for the [RESOURCE_NAME] resource in my SDK for [API_NAME].

The resource has the following attributes:
[LIST_ATTRIBUTES_WITH_TYPES]

The resource supports these operations:
[LIST_OPERATIONS - e.g., create, retrieve, update, delete, list]

API endpoint details for this resource:
[ENDPOINT_DETAILS_FOR_RESOURCE]

Please provide a well-structured Ruby class for this resource that:
- Implements attribute accessors properly
- Handles serialization/deserialization to/from API format
- Implements all supported operations
- Follows Ruby idioms and best practices
- Includes proper documentation
