I'm building a Ruby SDK to interface with [API_NAME] for integration into Rails applications. 
Please help me create the initial structure for this SDK with the following requirements:

- Gemspec setup with appropriate dependencies
- Standard Ruby project directory structure
- Proper namespacing
- Configuration approach that works well with Rails initializers
- Error handling architecture
- Logging capabilities
- Test framework setup with RSpec

The API I'm interfacing with handles [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_OF_API_FUNCTIONALITY].
The main resources/endpoints are:
[LIST_KEY_RESOURCES_OR_ENDPOINTS]

Please provide the initial directory structure and key files with code snippets for this SDK.
