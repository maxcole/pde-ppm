Implement a UI in a rails project

The below text came from an interaction with Claude where I gave him a screenshot to identify the coding problem.

For UI work it will be good to provide a graphic designs of what needs to get built. That will go much faster



Providing the screenshot was extremely helpful because it showed exactly what was happening - the checkboxes were being rendered but separated from their text. Visual examples are always valuable when dealing with UI and display issues like this.

In future requests involving UI components, describing the exact visual relationship between elements (like "checkbox directly adjacent to its text") helps create a clearer mental model of what you're looking for.
