I need to optimize my Ruby SDK for [API_NAME] for integration with Rails applications.

Please provide:
- Rails initializer template
- ActiveSupport instrumentation integration
- Integration with Rails logging
- Strategies for handling configuration in different environments
- Recommendations for including the SDK in a Rails application
- Best practices for error handling in a Rails context
