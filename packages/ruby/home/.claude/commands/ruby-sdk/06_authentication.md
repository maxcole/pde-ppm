I need to implement authentication for my Ruby SDK for [API_NAME].

Authentication method: [AUTH_METHOD_DETAILS]
Token expiration handling requirements: [EXPIRATION_DETAILS]
Required credentials: [LIST_REQUIRED_CREDENTIALS]

Please provide Ruby code that implements a robust authentication system that:
- Properly manages credentials
- Securely stores tokens
- Handles token refresh when needed
- Works well with Rails configuration
- Provides clear documentation for users
