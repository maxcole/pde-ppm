I need to upgrade my Ruby SDK for [API_NAME] to support their new API version.

Changes in the new API version:
[LIST_API_CHANGES]

Current SDK implementation details:
[CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]

Please provide a strategy and code examples for:
- Implementing version support
- Handling backward compatibility
- Providing a smooth migration path for users
- Testing changes against both API versions
